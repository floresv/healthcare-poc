# React PoC - FoodApp

This application serves as a proof of concept for a food ordering platform. It allows users to:

- Browse food categories and meals
- Search for specific meals within categories
- Add items to a shopping cart
- Place orders through a simple checkout process

The app demonstrates modern web development practices using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with a focus on responsive design and user experience. It integrates with a backend API to fetch meal and category data, and uses local storage to manage the shopping cart state.
